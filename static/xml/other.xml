<a href="http://www.pbtracker.net">PB Tracker</a> is a web app for tracking <a href="/personal#vids">speedrunning</a> times, personal bests (PBs) and viewing other runners' PBs. 
Runners sign up and submit their times to populate their very own personal runner page. 
This runner page is the main feature of PB Tracker, providing a useful reference point for looking up a runner's best times. 
In addition, PB Tracker includes individual game pages that list all the submitted times for the corresponding game, sorted by time. 
These game pages allow runners to compare their own times with other PB Trackers, as well as keep track of the best known time for a given game and category.

This hobby project began as an improvement over my old method of tracking and posting my own PBs through spreadsheets and HTML-generating scripts. 
I quickly realized that it would not be too difficult to release PB Tracker out to the public so that others may make use of these tools as well. 
On the tech side of things, the app is written in Python and deployed on <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. 
I am making use of a lot of other web projects, including <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a>, <a href="https://gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> and <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>. 
The project is open source and <a href="https://github.com/rggibson/pb-tracker">available through GitHub</a>. 
I have learned a lot about web development by working on PB Tracker and I continue to maintain and update the site when I have the time.
