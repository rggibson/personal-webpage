I am a big fan of European-style board games.
While I still enjoy more familiar games such as Monopoly and RISK, most Euro games feature more strategy, more player engagement, and no player elimination.
I have a small collection of euro games with some of my favourites being <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42/tigris-euphrates">Tigris & Euphrates</a>, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602/caylus">Caylus</a>, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne">Carcossonne</a> (pictured above), and <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola">Agricola</a>.
I have even played in a small board game tournament where I finished second place in a field of about 20 or so board gamers.

I love Monopoly and think it is a way better game than most board gamers give it credit for.
Yes, it has some negative qualities such as player elimination and a lot of luck, but the strategy required to make successful trades can be very challenging and rewarding.
I own several versions of Monopoly, including the standard version, Victoriaopoly, <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24764/monopoly-mega-edition">Monopoly: The Mega Edition</a>, a Korean version, and a really old British version from the 1950's.
For added strategy, I suggest using the alternative rule where every unowned property, when landed on, is sold at an auction.
This way there is less luck as properties go to the highest bidder rather than to the lucky person that landed on the property.
