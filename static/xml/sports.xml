<Details><![CDATA[
I only started playing tennis regularly in 2009, but it has quickly become one of my favourite sports to play.
I have won a few singles tournaments and have been knocked out early in other tournaments, but I am about a 4.5-5.0 player.
Other than an occasional hit on the wood courts at Savary Island, I have only ever played on hard courts, indoor and out.
I also generally just play singles because I am trash at doubles.
In addition, I enjoy watching professional tennis on TV with my favourite player being Andy Murray, pictured above.

While I am absolutely terrible at ice hockey, I played a lot of ball hockey throughout my youth.
My favourite position is in goal, probably because I idolized Patrick Roy as a kid.
I was also a fan of Curtis Joseph growing up and when I play, I wear a mask similar to his.
I'm also a die-hard Montreal Canadiens fan.

<Details><![CDATA[
Although I have played little real baseball since graduating from Little League, I am still a big fan of the sport.
I have kept up by playing slo-pitch when I can since my first year of university.
I am also a big Red Sox fan and try to catch their games that come on TV.
Now most of my baseball time is spent coaching my kids' Little League teams.

<Details><![CDATA[
Soccer was the first organized sport that I played back when I was just 7 years old.
I played all through elementary school and high school, but now only play occasionally.
Likely thanks to my ball hockey experience, I enjoy playing goalkeeper more than any other position.
I somewhat follow the Premier League and my favourite team is Liverpool FC.

<Details><![CDATA[
Although I rarely play basketball these days, I did play for my high school teams at Colquitz Jr. Secondary School and Spectrum Community School in Victoria.
Playing high school basketball was a lot of work, but also a lot of fun and I learned a lot from some great coaches.
Since I'm not the biggest guy around, my entire game pretty much relied on being able to shoot the ball reasonably well.
Above is a picture of what I would look like if I could dunk.

I don't really know how to fish, but luckily I have friends that do.
Typically we like to go catch some big salmon as seen in the photo above, where I am the furthest on the left.
We also often trap for crabs and prawns and have had quite a bit of success fishing around Savary Island near Powell River, BC.
