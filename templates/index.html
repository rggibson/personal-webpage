<b>UPDATE</b> - I will be permanently moving to Victoria, BC in July, 2013 before I defend my thesis later in the fall.

<p>
Welcome to my web page! 
My name is Richard Gibson and I am currently completing my Ph.D. in <a href="http://cs.ualberta.ca/">Computing Science</a> at the <a href="http://ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>.  
I am a member of the <a href="http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/">Computer Poker Research Group</a> where the focus of my Ph.D. thesis is in artificial intelligence and computational game theory, specifically in domains involving more than two agents.  
From 2010 to the present, I have been the main author of Hyperborean3p, a program that plays 3-player limit Texas hold'em.  
Hyperborean3p won the 3-player events at the 2012 <a href="http://www.computerpokercompetition.org">Annual Computer Poker Competition</a> and is arguably the best 3-player poker program in the world. 
</p>

<p>
While my current studies are in Computing Science, my academic background is primarily in Mathematics where I hold a Master's degree from Simon Fraser University. 
In general, I am interested in fun and challenging problems where I can utilize both my computing and mathematical expertise. 
I am particular interested in pursuing:

  <li><a href="/industry?t=gamedev">Video Game Development</a></li>
  <li><a href="/industry?t=startups">Tech Startups</a></li>
</ul>
