      Welcome to my web page!
      My name is Richard Gibson and I live in Victoria, BC.
      I currently have a number of projects on the go.
      The majority of my working hours right now are spent doing game development with <a href="http://metalheadsoftware.com">Metalhead Software</a> on <a href="/projects#super-mega-baseball">Super Mega Baseball 2</a>.
      SMB2 is a fun, accessible baseball video game set to release in Spring 2018 for XBox One, Playstation 4, and Steam.
      On the side, I have a new sports pool game called <a href="/projects#bracket-bids">Bracket Bids</a> that combines elements of pick'em games and traditional fantasy sports.
      Bracket Bids promotes strategy over sports knowledge and offers a lower barrier to entry than typical fantasy offerings on the market.
      In addition, <a href="/projects#poker">I also consult with professional poker players</a>.
      I build game-theoretic optimal poker AI programs and analytics software to help improve their game.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2014, I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="http://cs.ualberta.ca/">Computing Science</a> at the <a href="http://ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>.
      As a member of the <a href="http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/">Computer Poker Research Group</a>, the focus of my Ph.D. thesis is in artificial intelligence and computational game theory, specifically in domains involving more than two agents.
      From 2010 to 2013, I was the main author of <em>Hyperborean3p</em>, a program that plays 3-player limit Texas hold'em.
      Hyperborean3p has won the 3-player events at the <a href="http://www.computerpokercompetition.org">Annual Computer Poker Competition</a> for five years running and is arguably the best 3-player poker program in the world.
      Before engaging in Computing Science, I studied Mathematics and hold a Master's degree in Math from Simon Fraser University.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work and studying, I enjoy playing several <a href="/personal#sports">sports</a>, including tennis, baseball and ball hockey.
      In addition, I am an <a href="/personal#vids">avid video game player</a> and love playing games both casually and competitively.
      Finally, I also enjoy building apps related to my hobbies that others can use and enjoy too.
      Examples include <a href="https://bracketbids.com">Bracket Bids</a>, described above, and <a href="/projects#pbtracker">PB Tracker</a>, a website for tracking video game speedruns.
