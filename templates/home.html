      Welcome to my web page! 
      My name is Richard Gibson and I live in Victoria, BC, Canada.
      I currently work remotely with a small group of professional poker players as a <a href="/other#pokerconsulting">computer programmer and consultant</a> to help improve their play. 
      Some aspects of my work include building game-theoretic optimal computer poker programs, hosting them on a private online poker "training" room and developing custom software for analyzing the programs' strategies. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I recently completed my Ph.D. in <a href="http://cs.ualberta.ca/">Computing Science</a> at the <a href="http://ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>.  
      As a member of the <a href="http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/">Computer Poker Research Group</a>, the focus of my Ph.D. thesis is in artificial intelligence and computational game theory, specifically in domains involving more than two agents.  
      From 2010 to 2013, I was the main author of <em>Hyperborean3p</em>, a program that plays 3-player limit Texas hold'em.  
      Hyperborean3p has won the 3-player events at the <a href="http://www.computerpokercompetition.org">Annual Computer Poker Competition</a> for five years running and is arguably the best 3-player poker program in the world. 
    </p0>

    <p>
      Before engaging in Computing Science, I studied Mathematics and hold a Master's degree in Math from Simon Fraser University. 
      In general, I am interested in fun and challenging problems where I can utilize both my computing and mathematical expertise. 
      I am particularly interested in pursuing:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="/academia">Research in Artificial Intelligence and Games</a></li>
	<li><a href="/industry?t=gamedev">Video Game Development</a></li>
	<li><a href="/industry?t=startups">Tech Startups</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work and studying, I enjoy playing several <a href="/personal#sports">sports</a>, including tennis, baseball and ball hockey.
      Furthermore, I am an <a href="/personal#vids">avid video game player</a> and love playing games both casually and competitively.
      Finally, I'm a husband to my wife Melissa and dad to my son Jack who was born in 2013.
